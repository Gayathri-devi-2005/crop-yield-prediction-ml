# Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict crop yield using real-world agricultural data.

## Dataset
FAO agricultural statistics dataset containing crop yield values across years and regions.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding (crop type, year, region)
- Train-test split
- Linear Regression model
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R²

## Results
The model shows low R² due to limited features in the dataset.
This highlights the importance of environmental and regional factors in crop yield prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Execution
The project was developed and executed in Google Colab.
